TTL UART w/ flow control from the pandora ext port
--------------------------------------------------

Parts list:
- 1* 74LVC14AD SO-14 "Hex inverting Schmitt trigger with 5 V tolerant input"
- 1* 0.1u 0603 cap
- 2* NX3008NBKW,115 SOT-323 n-ch mosfet
- 2* 4k7 4x0603 resistor arrays
- pandora ext port connector

The PCB is shared at oshpark:

remember to pick the 0.8mm service

This takes out the UART2 (not the debug UART but the one with flow control)
of the pandora ext port into the familiar 6-pin 0.1" header (*)
and converts it to 2.8V levels and provides the ext port power as the VCC.

Inputs are 5V tolerant so you can ignore the VCC and interface with 
CMOS devices running at 2.8 - 4.2V. 2.8V might be out-of-spec as a one
for 5V CMOS devices but it will not harm the device if you try anyways.
It should be fine for 5V TTL devices.

(* N.B. the 6th pin is RTS and not DTR as you might've hoped, but you might
be able to workaround this in software if you want that... )
